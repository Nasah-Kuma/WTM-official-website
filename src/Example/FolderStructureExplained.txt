For this, we will take the landing page as an example

# The landing page has 6 different sections.
    *So we  have a folder called Components with a Landing Page folder in it.
    *The landingPage folder will have 6 folders in it for section1 to section6.
    *Each contributor is required to create a folder in the section they are working on. The folder will have a jsx file and a css file.
    *Import your jsx file in the App.js when your done working (Ensure the mobile responsiveness of the component your working on)
    *Make a PR. Your code will be reviewed and if all is okay, it'll be merged to the main branch.
